# How to choose the right configuration 

You need to know the firmware version of your device and then you can pick the one with the good version.

    - /!\ If you use the micropelt-mlr003 with the REV2.a configuration and you don't use the external temperature sensor feature juste remove the usedTemperature BACnet object from the configuration else way you will have an error
    - You can also use the other configuration
